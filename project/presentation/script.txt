Hi everyone, my name is Henry Wat and here I am presenting my CS fifty P Final project ((⏱️=1000))titled ((⏱️=1000))Weather Forecast 5 Days.((⏱️=1000)) You are welcome to visit my git hub page to leave comments.

I'm trying something new in my project, it's API calls, it's straight forward by following the API documentation and handling the json response, but I was having trouble making python test case.

There are three additional packages required besides python which are included in requirements.txt

other than main function, there are 3 more functions in the project.py.((⏱️=1000)) these are valid date, ((⏱️=500))to validate the input date. ((⏱️=1500))fetch weather data,((⏱️=500)) sending API request to server and validate the response. ((⏱️=1500))format weather data, ((⏱️=1000))tidy up the response and return useful information.

there are 5 test functions totally. ((⏱️=1000))test validate date and test format weather. ((⏱️=1000))rest of 3 is testing different states of fetch weather data function.

during testing, i found that the API response will change according to time, by doing research, mocking test package helped a lot.

in this project, i setup an virtual environment, activate it, and install the necessary package via requirements.txt

let's see the outcomes of the project. ((⏱️=1500))since it is a 5 days weather forecast ((⏱️=1000))and the presentation date is 12 March 2024, ((⏱️=1000))so there would be no data before 12 march and after 17 march.
if the input an invalid date like 30 Feb,  u will be asked to enter the date again. ((⏱️=1000))if the input date is out of range, no data will be fetched.((⏱️=1500))
if input a valid city and date, the weather forecast will be shown.
for example, Calgary at 2024-3-12, the weather is cloudy and around 7.13 degree celsius

here is the python test result. ((⏱️=1500))all pass! is it good?

That's all of the presentation,((⏱️=1000)) thank you
